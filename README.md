# Flask Project BLOG-POSTS

This is a practical project of the flask course, implemented user authentication functionality in the application and created a profile manager for users. We implemented the functionality to upload photos and perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on the blog posts.

Finally, search functionality was implemented in the application, allowing users to search for specific blog posts.
